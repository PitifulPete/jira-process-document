# Process document 
A company that wanted to hire me requested that i create a process document explaining how i will document a newly created feature for one of Atlassian's software products. I created and submitted the document, but i thought it was a fun project so i decided to make it a proper organizational process document. 
## Overview 
This document explains the process for creating a clear and concise user guide on how to use a new Jira software feature. It includes the process of collecting information about the feature, documenting the feature, and formatting the document.
## How to collect information about a new Jira feature
The first step when trying to document a new feature is to understand the feature. You need to understand why the feature was created, the value our users will derive from using the feature, and the step-by-step process of using the feature. Collecting information helps you attain this understanding. To collect information about a new feature, you should explore the feature and validate the outcome of your exploration.

**Explore the feature**   

Exploring a feature means experimenting with the feature. You need to use the feature to perform all its possible functions in order to see its value and determine how users can efficiently perform the same functions using the feature. It is important that you also determine if the feature performs its functions as intended and if the process of using the feature is convenient enough for the average user.

**Validate the outcome of your exploration** 

Validation is essential because your understanding of the feature should be consistent with the intention behind the creation of the feature. You should ensure this by cross-functionally relating with the product development team to validate every detail and clarify issues detected during exploration.

You can proceed to documenting the feature after the information obtained has been validated. If the complication perceived while exploring the feature is by design and will not be rectified, you should regard it while documenting and still ensure that the document is user-friendly.
## How to document the feature
Documenting the feature is the next step after collecting information about the feature. You should adopt a combination of the [Atlassian content style guide](https://atlassian.design/content) and general industry standards to ensure that the document is clear and consistent. In a situation where the company’s style guide conflicts with the general industry standards, you should prioritize the company’s style guide.

**The Atlassian content style guide**

You should maintain the content style guide while documenting to ensure clarity and consistency. The content style guide gives instructions on tone, sentence structure, and formatting. For instance, some of the instructions provided are:
* ***Sentence case capitalization in all headings and labels*** - sentence case capitalization capitalizes the first word and every proper noun in a heading. As an example, **“The similarities between Atlassian style guide and Google style guide"** is correct while **“The Similarities Between Atlassian Style Guide and Google Style Guide” is wrong.**
* ***Oxford comma*** - the style guide requires the use of Oxford commas. As an example, **“Jira is used by software developers, lawyers, and human resource specialists”** is correct while **“Jira is used by software developers, lawyers and human resource specialists”** is wrong.
* ***The second-person pronoun*** - the guide promotes the usage of the second-person pronoun over every other form of pronouns. As an example, **“you should maintain consistency while documenting”** is correct while **“the writer should maintain consistency while documenting”** is wrong.  

The style guide has been fully documented on the [Atlassian website.](https://atlassian.design/content)

**General industry standard**

Regardless of the style guide the document is tailored towards, there are general standards that should be maintained while writing a document. In order to create a clear and consistent user guide, your writing must implement the 7 Cs of communication. The user guide must be:
* ***Clear*** - you should convey the purpose of the document to users without using jargon, obscure words, or complex phrases. That is, you should get straight to the point and do it unambiguously.
* ***Concise*** - you should convey the most meaning with the least words by using active and forceful verbs, eliminating redundancies, and avoiding cliched expressions.
* ***Concrete*** - you should aim for precision by using exact words and phrases. For instance: use **ten thousand people** instead of an obscure description like **many people.**
* ***Coherent*** - you should logically link ideas while writing by using transitional words and phrases. E.g., for instance, specifically, meanwhile.
* ***Correct*** - you should ensure that your writing is correct by using accurate grammar and information.  
* ***Complete*** - you should ensure that the user guide contains all relevant details and achieve its intended goals.
* ***Courteous*** - you should prioritize the readers throughout the writing process by ensuring that your approach is user-centered.
## How to format the document
The company’s style guide also provides instructions on how to format a document. Some integral parts of a document like title and list are already addressed in the style guide. In addition to those parts, you should implement formatting guidelines that are not included in the Atlassian style guide but will enhance the document. For instance, you should make use of:
* ***Passive space*** - it can be implemented by strategically leaving blank space in a document. Passive space is different from active space in that the presence of active space is necessary in a document while the presence of passive space is optional. For instance, passive space can be applied after a diagram and before a new heading to stress the difference between those two parts of the document.
* ***Font formatting*** - font can be used to enhance the quality of the user guide. Font size, type, and color can be used to emphasize certain qualities and showcase certain differences in the document. For instance, the font size of heading 1 and heading 2 in this document was formatted differently to spotlight the difference between the two headings. 
* ***Figures*** - figures can enhance the readability of the user guide. Figures can be used to supplement textual explanations, therefore, improving users’ understanding. Even though figures used in a document need to be self-explanatory, figures should not be used as a substitute for textual description but as a complement. Examples of figures are images and diagrams. 
## Conclusion 
This document has explained the company's process for creating a user guide about new software features. Though creating a document requires a certain level of flexibility, the process described here serves as the foundation for creating a user guide detailing how to use our features.
